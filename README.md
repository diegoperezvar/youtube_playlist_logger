# youtube_playlist_logger
this programm will use pytube to read all the URL´s in a youtube playlist, associate them to the video´s title and save them into a file.  The purpose of this programm is to prevent loosing videos from a playlist due to their removal from the platform.


!!!! The number of videos you need to introduce may be less than the total amount the program returns, this may be because some videos in the playlist are private.
